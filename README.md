# ChromaChords
ChromaChords is an Arduino BLE project that leverages machine learning to recognize different music genres.

# Introduction:
ChromaChords is an Arduino BLE project that leverages machine learning to recognize different music genres. By training the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense with the GTZAN dataset of audio samples, the system accurately classifies music into various genres in real-time.

Key Features:
- Audio genre recognition using Edge Impulse platform and TensorFlow
- Real-time genre classification on the Arduino BLE Sense device
- Diverse dataset for comprehensive coverage of music genres
- Easy-to-use interface for seamless interaction

Tech Stack:
Arduino, Edge Impulse, TensorFlow, C++

Installation and Setup:
Detailed instructions for installing and setting up the project locally can be found in the README. You also can clone the
project here: https://studio.edgeimpulse.com/public/251605/latest 

Usage:
Users can upload music samples or stream audio to the Arduino BLE Sense to get instant genre recognition.
